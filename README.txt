Mobile Application Development Project

Eni Mahmutaj

My project is called Recipes and it is about recipes of different cultures in the world. 
This application has multiple activities. The fist activity that we see is the login in the LoginActivity, so it runs from this activity. 
It has the username and password EditText and a button that redirects to the next activity. The username and predefined as: 
Username: Admin and Password: 1234.
The next activity is the MainActivity that has a list (listView) of recipes categories objects with photos (imageView). 
This objects are taken from the activity CustomAdapter and the class Recipes. The recipes categories are clickable and each redirects in different 
activities. In this activities there is a button called Map, a youtube player and another button called play. The button Map shows a view of google 
map of the place that this recipe category is created. This is done with intent. The play button opens the youtube video of the recipe. The youtube 
player presents videos through API. The API is included in the YoutubeCongic activity.
I have included some simple Ui design.
